# BioE-231-Labs

The files in this folder are mostly jupyter notebooks that were completed as homework for BioEng 231 "Introduction to Computational Molecular and Cell Biology" at UC Berkeley. This class teaches basic bioinformatics and computational biology, with an emphasis on alignment, phylogeny, and ontologies. Supporting foundational topics are also reviewed with an emphasis on bioinformatics topics, including basic molecular biology, probability theory, and information theory.
